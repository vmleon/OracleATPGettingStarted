# Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing

## Getting Started for developers and operators

This workshop walks you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing** (ATP).

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands of mission critical transaction processing and mixed workload applications.

## Who Should Read This Workshop

You want to **develop applications** that connect to Oracle Databases in the Cloud.

You want to **manage Oracle Autonomous databases** in Oracle Cloud.

You are also interested in exploring other technologies to build **Cloud Native applications**.

## Requirements

In order to walk through this workshop you need an **active Oracle Cloud Account**. If you don't have one:

[>> Please Sign-Up a Free Tier Oracle Cloud account <<](http://bit.ly/34TzwGf)

> It takes few minutes to fully-provision your account.

After you log-in in your Oracle Cloud Account, you should see the web console, like this:
